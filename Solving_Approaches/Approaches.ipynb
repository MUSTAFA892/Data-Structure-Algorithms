    "### 1. **Two Pointer Approach**\n",
    "   - **Description**: This approach uses two pointers to traverse the array or list. The two pointers either move towards each other or move in the same direction depending on the problem at hand.\n",
    "   - **Types**:\n",
    "     - **Slow and Fast Pointers**: Used to detect cycles in a linked list (e.g., Floyd’s Tortoise and Hare algorithm).\n",
    "     - **Left and Right Pointers**: Used in problems like the **container with most water** or **3-sum problem**, where you can optimize time complexity by adjusting two pointers from both ends.\n",
    "   - **Example**: In the \"sorted array two-sum problem\", one pointer starts at the beginning, and the other at the end. The sum of the numbers at the pointers is checked, and the pointers are adjusted based on the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Sliding Window Approach**\n",
    "   - **Description**: This technique is used for problems where you need to examine all subarrays or substrings of a certain size or under some condition. Instead of recalculating the result for every window from scratch, the sliding window reuses the previous computations.\n",
    "   - **Example**: **Find the maximum sum of a subarray of size k**. You can calculate the sum of the first `k` elements, then slide the window one step forward by subtracting the element going out of the window and adding the element coming into the window.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Greedy Algorithm**\n",
    "   - **Description**: Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding the global optimum. The goal is to always make the best choice in the current scenario.\n",
    "   - **Use Cases**: Problems like **Huffman coding**, **coin change**, and **interval scheduling**.\n",
    "   - **Example**: In the **activity selection problem**, you always choose the next activity that finishes the earliest, hoping that this will leave the most time for subsequent activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Divide and Conquer**\n",
    "   - **Description**: The divide-and-conquer approach splits a problem into smaller subproblems, solves them independently, and then combines the solutions.\n",
    "   - **Use Cases**: Sorting algorithms like **Merge Sort**, **Quick Sort**, and **Binary Search**.\n",
    "   - **Example**: **Merge Sort** divides the array into halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**\n",
    "   - **Description**: Dynamic programming is used when a problem can be broken down into overlapping subproblems. It avoids redundant calculations by storing the results of subproblems and reusing them (either through memoization or tabulation).\n",
    "   - **Use Cases**: Problems like **Knapsack**, **Fibonacci sequence**, **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**.\n",
    "   - **Memoization vs. Tabulation**:\n",
    "     - **Memoization** (Top-Down): Recursively solves subproblems and caches results.\n",
    "     - **Tabulation** (Bottom-Up): Iteratively solves subproblems by filling a table (array).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Backtracking**\n",
    "   - **Description**: Backtracking is a form of recursion where you build a solution incrementally and backtrack when you find that the solution cannot be completed.\n",
    "   - **Use Cases**: Problems like **N-Queens**, **Sudoku**, **combinations/permutations**.\n",
    "   - **Example**: In the **N-Queens problem**, backtracking places queens on the board one by one and backtracks when a valid solution can’t be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**\n",
    "   - **Description**: BFS explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It is used to traverse graphs or trees.\n",
    "   - **Use Cases**: Shortest path problems, **level order traversal** of trees, and **graph connectivity**.\n",
    "   - **Example**: BFS can be used to find the **shortest path in an unweighted graph**. Starting from the source node, BFS explores all neighbors first, then moves to the next level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**\n",
    "   - **Description**: DFS explores as far as possible down one branch of the tree or graph before backtracking.\n",
    "   - **Use Cases**: **Topological sorting**, **finding connected components** in a graph, **tree traversal**.\n",
    "   - **Example**: DFS can be used in solving **maze problems** where you explore a path, and if it's blocked, you backtrack and explore another route.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union - DSU)**\n",
    "   - **Description**: Union-Find is a data structure that efficiently supports **union** and **find** operations, particularly in problems involving connectivity between elements.\n",
    "   - **Use Cases**: Problems like **Kruskal’s algorithm** for Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), **connected components** in a graph, and **cycle detection**.\n",
    "   - **Example**: Union-Find is used in **MST algorithms** to check if adding an edge will form a cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Hashing**\n",
    "   - **Description**: Hashing is used to store and retrieve data in constant time by using a hash function. It can help solve problems like duplicate detection, frequency counting, or fast lookups.\n",
    "   - **Use Cases**: **Hash maps**, **set operations**, **counting elements**, and **caching**.\n",
    "   - **Example**: Using a hash map to count the frequency of elements in an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. **Topological Sort**\n",
    "   - **Description**: A topological sort is an ordering of the vertices in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge `u -> v`, `u` comes before `v`.\n",
    "   - **Use Cases**: Task scheduling, **dependencies**, and **build order**.\n",
    "   - **Example**: In task scheduling, if one task depends on another, topological sort can be used to determine the correct order in which tasks should be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. **Bit Manipulation**\n",
    "   - **Description**: Bit manipulation involves directly operating on the bits of integers using bitwise operators (`AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, `NOT`, etc.).\n",
    "   - **Use Cases**: **Finding the number of set bits**, **checking powers of 2**, **swapping values**, **encoding/decoding information**.\n",
    "   - **Example**: Using bitwise operators to **check if a number is a power of 2** by verifying if only one bit is set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13. **Matrix Exponentiation**\n",
    "   - **Description**: Matrix exponentiation is used for efficiently solving linear recurrence relations, such as the Fibonacci sequence, by using matrix multiplication.\n",
    "   - **Use Cases**: Problems like **Fibonacci numbers**, **solving linear recurrences**, and **matrix chain multiplication**.\n",
    "   - **Example**: In the Fibonacci sequence, the `nth` Fibonacci number can be computed by exponentiating a matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14. **Monotonic Stack**\n",
    "   - **Description**: A monotonic stack is a stack that maintains elements in a particular order (either increasing or decreasing).\n",
    "   - **Use Cases**: Problems like **next greater element**, **stock span**, **largest rectangle in histogram**.\n",
    "   - **Example**: Finding the **next greater element** for each element in an array. You can use a monotonic stack to efficiently solve this in linear time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15. **Top-Down/Bottom-Up Recursion**\n",
    "   - **Description**: Recursion is used for problems that have a recursive structure. Top-down involves memoization (storing results of recursive calls), while bottom-up involves iterative approaches (like tabulation).\n",
    "   - **Use Cases**: Recursive tree or graph problems, **divide-and-conquer** problems, and **dynamic programming**.\n",
    "   - **Example**: For computing **Fibonacci numbers**, you can use top-down recursion with memoization or bottom-up iteration with a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16. **Brute Force Approach**\n",
    "   - **Description**: The brute force approach is the simplest and most straightforward way to solve a problem, where you explore all possible solutions without any optimization. It doesn’t aim to minimize the time or space complexity, and instead relies on raw computation.\n",
    "   - **Use Cases**: Brute force is often used when:\n",
    "     - A problem has a small input size, so it's acceptable to check all possibilities.\n",
    "     - There are no obvious optimizations or patterns that can be exploited.\n",
    "     - The problem is simple enough that brute force would yield the correct answer in a reasonable time.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     - **Finding the maximum sum of a subarray**: A brute force solution would check all possible subarrays and calculate their sums to find the maximum.\n",
    "     - **Naive string matching**: In the case of string matching, a brute force algorithm would compare each substring of the text with the pattern one by one.\n",
