    "### üîç **Definition of Brute Force Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Brute Force** approach is a straightforward method for solving problems by trying all possible solutions and selecting the correct or best one. It doesn't use any optimization techniques ‚Äî it relies purely on **exhaustive search**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Think of it as **\"try everything and pick what works.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚öôÔ∏è **How Brute Force Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate all possible candidates**.\n",
    "2. **Check each candidate** to see if it satisfies the problem's conditions.\n",
    "3. **Return the solution** if found, or the best solution if multiple exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is often used when:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The problem size is small.\n",
    "* There are no known better (optimized) algorithms.\n",
    "* Simplicity is more important than efficiency.\n",

    "### üß† **Example: Brute Force for Finding a Target in an Array**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Given an array and a target number, check if the number exists in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def brute_force_search(arr, target):\n",
    "    for i in range(len(arr)):\n",
    "        if arr[i] == target:\n",
    "            return True\n",
    "    return False\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "arr = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n",
    "target = 6\n",
    "print(brute_force_search(arr, target))  # Output: True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the function checks each element in the array until it finds the target.\n",

    "### üì¶ **Another Example: Brute Force for Password Cracking**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you're trying to guess a 3-digit password made of digits 0-9. Brute force would try every combination from `000` to `999`.\n",
    "\n",

    "### ‚úÖ **Advantages of Brute Force**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and understand.\n",
    "2. **Guaranteed Results**: Will always find the solution if one exists.\n",
    "3. **No Heuristics Needed**: Doesn‚Äôt require deep knowledge of the problem.\n",
    "4. **Useful for Small Input Sizes**: Fast enough when the number of possibilities is low.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ùå **Disadvantages of Brute Force**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inefficient**: Time-consuming for large input sizes (exponential time in many cases).\n",
    "2. **High Computational Cost**: Uses more CPU/memory resources.\n",
    "3. **Not Scalable**: Fails to perform well as data size increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìä **Time Complexity**\n",
    "\n",
    "Varies based on the problem, but is often:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **O(n!)**, **O(2‚Åø)**, or **O(n¬≤)** in many brute force algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Searching an array: **O(n)**\n",
